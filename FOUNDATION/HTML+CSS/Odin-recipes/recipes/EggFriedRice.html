    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        My own personal egg fried rice recipe that I <br>
        often make for lunch.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Day Old Cooked Rice</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>
            Meat: Pork, Beef, Chicken <br>
            often already cooked and chopped
        </li>
        <li>Onions: diced</li>
        <li>Garlic: minced/ pressed</li>
        <li>Five Spice Powder</li>
        <li>White pepper</li>
        <li>Green Onion: sliced and separated based on whites and greens</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Put a wok to heat up over high heat, add neutral oil (vegetable, peanut, etc).
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly beat your eggs.
        </li>
        <li>
            when oil is shimmering, add your onion, garlic and the whites of the green onion. Stir for <br>
            30 seconds, then add your meat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir this mixture for a minute being careful not to burn the onion or garlic. Push everything to <br>
            the side of the wok and add your eggs.
        </li>
        <li>
            let the bottom of the egg cook before pushing the edges to the center and allowing the still wet <br>
            eggs to fill in the gaps. Once the eggs are almost fully cooked start to stir as if scrambling.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the Rice and stir/ toss the entire mixture, once everything is mixed together, add the white pepper, <br>
            soy sauce and five spice powder, and stir/ toss well to combine and coat all of the rice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place your rice onto a plate or into a bowl and garnish with the green slices of green onion.
        </li>
    </ol>
